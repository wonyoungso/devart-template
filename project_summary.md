## Description
Small World is an ongoing data collecting and mapping research project of Korean creators, collectives and the structure of its ecosystem. Having a bird-eye view of Korean creators, Wonyoung especially interested in how creators make work with others. this project aims to reveal the connections of creators emerging from these “collaboration”.

Creators seem to make a one big cluster. Having loose connections and networks from active authoring and working, Korean creators often collaborates with somewhat unfamiliar creative categories, such as modern dance and computer programming, music and physical computing, etc,. Through hub creators, its network can make completely new artworks from artists who doesn’t seem to know each other.

This project explores which community exists, to look deeply into their works and collaborations. Results are manipulated like interactive maps. It means that you could navigate hub creator makes ecosystem be more close, or what routes could be made if I would like to work with him/her. In the process of analyzing and visualizing the data, these lists of creators connect another creators/collectives via their work on the diagram, which organizes itself by running as a software simulation. It naturally find their position on the screen through connecting forces, revealing the central actors, indirect links, and creative communities.
